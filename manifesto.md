# FruitNotes Manifesto

## IMAGINING A NEW FRUITNOTES

This company was created because we wanted a cute notebook.
After some design work, we realized our notebooks could be
cute *and* accessible. We used multi-purpose pages, crazy
colors, and the power of doodling to make learning easy for
everyone. But we can't stop there.

## SOMETHING EVERYONE CAN USE

FruitNotes must be completely open. This means open source,
this means documented transactions, posted earnings, and most
importantly, it means accessibility. Accessibility by other
languages, accessibility by those with learning disabilities
like ADHD or dyslexia, accessibility with slow internet, or
an old laptop. Accessibility with a screen reader, or
physically with braille. If there's someone who can't
experience a FruitNotes product who isn't dead or newly born,
we're not doing it right.

## RADICAL SUSTAINABILITY

Every aspect of FruitNotes must be sustainable, natural, and
organic. This means intuitive, familiar design. It also means
ethical sourcing, packaging, and distribution. No harm to
animals, workers, or the planet itself. Reuse as much as
possible, and use as little as possible in the first place.
Every product must be fully recyclable. All power must be fully
renewable. No heavy metal inks, no bulky websites, no dirty
energy, no unsustainable tree products. Keep it lean, mean,
and most importantly: Green.

## CREATE AN ADVENTURE

You've got to be having fun when you're seeing FruitNotes. A
colorful pen, a thank you note, a cool accessory. It's not just
about brand image, either. The world can be dull, gloomy, and 
filled with depressing spirals out of control. With FruitNotes,
you should feel organized, collected, and responsible. It's
important to make sure that everyone is living their best journey,
and we plan to make that happen. Whether this involves contributions
to charities, buying union-made products, providing incentives
for sustainable and non-exploitative business, or canvassing for
environmental and social policy: It's important to make everyone
happier, for years to come.

## COMMITMENT FOREVER

The most important part of this manifesto is that FruitNotes
stays this way forever, which is why a copy of it will be
provided to every customer with one simple message: If we don't
hold through, stop giving us money.

It would, quite literally, mean the world to us.
